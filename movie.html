                    <q>Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped to excuse the
                        concept's inherent corniness, the movie attempts to look
                        polished and 'cool,' but the been-there animation can't compete
                        with the then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action
                        movie.</q>
